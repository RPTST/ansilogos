These are my two IBM logos I created using the DOS program "TheDraw"

To uise these files, simply copy them onto your PC, then you just need to use the command "type" to display them. 

Example:

type ibmlogo.ans

You _MUST_ have ANSI.SYS (or a similar driver) installed in your config.sys for them to work correctly. I recommand you use 'nansi.sys'
or 'nnansi.sys' as these are better and faster than the original MS-DOS ansi.sys.

You can get them here:
